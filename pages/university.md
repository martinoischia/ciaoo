#### Bayesian statistics

#### (Probabilistic) Measure theory


[The Borel Kolmogorov paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel%E2%80%93Kolmogorov_paradox)
, reason for which you need to define the limiting operation when you condition on a
0 probability event; measure theory "solves" this issue of conditional probability reasoning in terms
of sub-Ïƒ-algebras, introducing the concept of regular (version of a) conditional probability: conditional 
probability is defined as the conditional expectation of an indicator function. For more hints
have a look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability_distribution#Measure-theoretic_formulation)

#### A (not so) simple [exercise in probability](university/exercise probability.html)
I think it makes a good effort at showing the power of abstraction in Mathematics
