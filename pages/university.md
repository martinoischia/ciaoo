(Probabilistic) Measure theory:\\
[The Borel Kolmogorov paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel%E2%80%93Kolmogorov_paradox)
, reason for which you need to define the limiting operation when you condition on a
0 probability event, or also why you have to reason in terms of conditional expectation with respect to a
sub-Ïƒ-algebra (for example, the one generated by a random variable,
you need measurability with respect to that variable so that you can make integrals 
to compute conditional probabilities on sets that have measure greater than 0)
